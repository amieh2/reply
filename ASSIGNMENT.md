# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned to use the library by running the examples that the author provided on the repository. This allowed me to get a better understanding the module's code and how some methods work. One thing I would have changed to make the code easier to read is to maybe spit up the second funtion. The functions composed of a bunch of smaller functions making that entire method kind of hard to understand. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####

> When writing comments that raise the level of abstraction that means to write a comment at a higher level than the code. This means not explaining every detail that is happening step by step in the code but just a general summary of what the function is doing. If I had to explaing to a new CSE 142 student how to write an effective comment I would first tell them to write in a single sentence what their method is doing. Then add a sentence about parameters or return values. I would tell them not to write anything specific happening in their code and not to specify what kind of loops they are using because its not needed in the comment. 

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me approximately around 12 hours to complete this assignmnet. I spend most of my time tyring to understand the code. I went function by function testing the code and reading it. Then spent time on commenting the code. 


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I recieved help from Sally Li on downloading Jsdoc.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I didnt encounter any problems in this assinnment, it just took me a while to understand the module.
