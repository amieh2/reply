# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?

##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####

> When writing comments that raise the level of abstraction that means to write a comment at a higher level than the code. This means not explaining every detail that is happening step by step in the code but just a general summary of what the function is doing. If I had to explaing to a new CSE 142 student how to write an effective comment I would first tell them to write in a single sentence what their method is doing. Then add a sentence about parameters or return values. I would tell them not to write anything specific happening in their code and not to specify what kind of loops they are using because its not needed in the comment.
